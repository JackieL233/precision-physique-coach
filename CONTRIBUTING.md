# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially improvements that make the skill safer, clearer, more evidence-informed, or easier to adapt across LLM runtimes.

## Good Contributions

- Clearer coaching workflows.
- Better safety-screening language.
- More precise exercise substitutions or technique cues.
- Evidence-informed updates with reputable citations.
- Templates for check-ins, weekly plans, or progress reports.
- Tests or validation scripts for skill metadata.

## Standards

- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and procedural.
- Put detailed domain material in `references/`.
- Do not add medical diagnosis or treatment claims.
- Avoid extreme dieting, dehydration, or drug-use advice.
- Prefer practical decision rules over vague motivation.
