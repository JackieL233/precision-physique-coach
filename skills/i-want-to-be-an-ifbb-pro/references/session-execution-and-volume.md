# Session Execution and Volume Tracking

Use this to guide each workout, track training quality, and translate session data into growth decisions.

## Session Log Fields

Track at exercise-level and set-level when possible:

- Date, session name, goal phase.
- Exercise, movement pattern, target muscle.
- Set number, load, reps, RIR or RPE, rest time.
- Tempo/range notes when relevant.
- Technique quality from 1-5.
- Target-muscle stimulus from 1-5.
- Pain from 0-10.
- Completion status and notes.

This session log is the source of truth for exercise-level decisions.

## Warm-up Ramp Plan

Before judging the first working set, translate the next exercise, planned load, target reps, target RIR, readiness status, and exercise visual guide ID into a warm-up ramp set checklist.

- Start with general prep, then use light, moderate, and near-work ramp sets for the first main movement.
- For loaded exercises, express ramp loads as approximate percentages of the planned working load and round to practical plates or machine-stack jumps.
- For bodyweight or machine settings without a known load, use easier variations, assistance, partial-effort sets, or lower settings before the first working set.
- Use an extra near-work checkpoint when readiness is only moderate, soreness is elevated, technique is uncertain, or the user is returning after missed training.
- The final ramp set should confirm speed, control, target-muscle feel, visual-guide setup match, pain-free range, and whether the first working set gate is passed.
- Do not count warm-up ramp sets as hard sets unless the user explicitly pushed them near failure by mistake; if that happens, note it as fatigue leakage before progression decisions.

If the final ramp set is unstable, painful, much harder than expected, or does not match the intended movement path, start the first working set lighter, repeat a lighter ramp set, reduce volume, or use Exercise Substitution Coach before changing the long-term plan.

## Training Closeout Coach

After the working sets and Session Quality Dashboard, run a final closeout gate before changing the next plan.

- Confirm planned sets vs completed sets and do not treat an unfinished workout as a clean progression signal.
- Check missing set logs: actual reps, load, RIR, rest time, completion state, and set notes.
- Treat pain flags and technique flags as progression blockers until the user logs context, modifies the movement, or attaches form/equipment photo evidence.
- Link form/equipment photos back to the Unified Exercise Visual Atlas, closest visual guide ID, equipment/action setup, and movement path before judging technique.
- Check whether post-workout nutrition, food-photo evidence, body/recovery metrics, Health Connect sync, and session notes are present before a high-confidence AI review.
- Use the closeout score and AI review readiness as a gate: if set data, photos, food, or metrics are missing, ask for the smallest useful evidence before changing load, volume, calories, or tomorrow's plan.

The closeout response should name the primary action: finish sets, complete set logs, attach form/equipment evidence, log post-workout food, sync metrics, or run the AI review.

## Key Metrics

- **Hard sets:** sets close enough to failure to count for the target muscle.
- **Tonnage:** load x reps x sets; useful for stable exercises, not comparable across very different movements.
- **Estimated effective reps:** rough proxy for reps near failure; useful only when RIR is logged.
- **Top set performance:** best load/reps/RIR combination for a stable movement.
- **Volume landmarks:** practical ranges for minimum effective volume, adaptive volume, maximum recoverable volume, inferred from the user's response.
- **Training quality:** combination of technique, target stimulus, pain, rest discipline, and RIR accuracy.

Do not chase tonnage if target stimulus, joint tolerance, or technique worsens.

## Counting Rules

Hard set:

- Count when RIR is 0-4 and technique quality is at least 3/5.
- For beginners, sets farther from failure may still be useful for skill, but label them practice sets.
- Do not count sets with pain 5+/10 as productive hard sets.

Tonnage:

- Sum load x reps for each working set.
- Bodyweight movements can use added load only, estimated bodyweight load, or be tracked by reps and RIR instead.

Effective reps:

- Simple estimate: if RIR is 0-5, effective reps = min(reps, 5 - RIR). If RIR is above 5, use 0.
- Treat this as a trend marker, not physiology truth.

## Training Quality Review

After each session, classify:

- **High quality:** planned work completed, target stimulus strong, technique stable, pain low.
- **Productive but watch:** performance okay but fatigue, soreness, or minor pain rising.
- **Low quality:** missed reps, poor target stimulus, technique breakdown, excessive pain, or poor recovery.

## Progression Decision

At exercise-level:

- Add load when all sets hit top of rep range at target RIR with good technique and pain under 3/10.
- Add reps when load is stable and RIR is easier than target.
- Keep the same prescription when performance is on plan but not yet ready to progress.
- Reduce load or sets when technique decays, pain rises, or reps fall unexpectedly.
- Swap exercise when repeated poor stimulus or joint irritation appears despite reasonable modifications.

At muscle-level:

- Add 1-2 weekly hard sets when progress is flat and recovery is good.
- Maintain volume when progress is on target.
- Reduce volume when soreness, joint stress, or performance decline suggests overreaching.
