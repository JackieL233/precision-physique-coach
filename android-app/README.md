# I Want to be an IFBB PRO Android App

This is a native Android companion app for the `I Want to be an IFBB PRO` skill. It packages the skill assets inside the APK and lets you call an AI API for training, nutrition, visual form analysis, food-photo nutrition estimates, and linked check-ins.

## What is included

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose Android app.
- Bundled skill assets in `app/src/main/assets/skill/`.
- Apple-inspired light UI theme with a quiet neutral background, blue action color, rounded grouped surfaces, and bottom navigation for the main daily tabs.
- A `Today` Command Center with readiness, next action, training, nutrition, recovery, and body-composition cards so beginners know what to do first while advanced users can scan the key numbers.
- Local daily log history with a 7-day trend summary for body weight, calories, protein, sleep, steps, hard sets, and training volume.
- Coach modes for new plans, check-ins, training visual analysis, food visual analysis, linked training + nutrition analysis, existing plan audit, and evidence explanations.
- Configurable API key, base URL, and model from the app UI.
- OpenAI Responses API request shape with text and photos.
- Photo picker support for exercise frames, equipment photos, food photos, labels, and menus.
- A weekly training plan workflow for phase goals, training days, planned exercises, sets, reps, RIR, rest time, and notes.
- An `Apply today` workflow that turns a planned training day into today's set-level executable workout log.
- A daily training workflow for planned focus, completed sessions, exercises, set-level load, reps, RIR, rest time, hard sets, target muscle, and form/pain notes.
- A workout execution flow where tapping a set as complete starts a rest countdown for the next set.
- A daily nutrition workflow for calorie and macro targets, meal logging, meal photo support, and food-photo estimate follow-up.
- A daily metrics workflow for body weight, waist, sleep, steps, hunger, fatigue, soreness, stress, and reflection.
- Health Connect sync for user-authorized body weight, body fat, lean body mass, steps, sleep, resting heart rate, and total calories burned. Xiaomi, Huawei, scale, watch, and phone data can be imported when the source app writes those records into Health Connect.
- An AI review workflow that summarizes the day and asks the model what to adjust tomorrow.
- AI review includes recent trend rows so recommendations can compare today's execution against recent training, nutrition, recovery, and body-composition direction.
- An AI Data Map that makes the connected analysis surface explicit: exercise selection, set load, actual reps, RIR, rest time, hard sets, tonnage, technique notes, pain flags, meal macros, food photos, equipment/form photos, body weight, body fat, lean mass, waist, sleep, steps, resting heart rate, calorie burn, hunger, fatigue, soreness, and stress.

## Daily workflow

Use the app as a daily training and daily nutrition cockpit:

1. Open `Today` to see the current training, nutrition, metrics, and readiness summary.
   The Command Center shows the next best action and a beginner-friendly daily loop: plan, train, log food, sync health data, then run AI review.
   The 7-day trend card shows whether body weight, food intake, hard sets, sleep, and activity are moving in the right direction.
2. Use `Plan` to build the weekly training plan, select a day, add planned exercises, and tap `Apply today`.
3. Use `Training` to log the applied session, set-by-set weight, reps, RIR, rest time, hard sets, target muscle, and pain/form notes. Tap `Complete` after a set to start the rest timer.
4. Use `Nutrition` to set calorie/macronutrient targets, log meals, and attach a meal photo when you want food-photo analysis.
5. Use `Metrics` for body weight, body fat, lean mass, waist, sleep, steps, resting heart rate, calorie burn, hunger, fatigue, soreness, stress, and daily reflection. Tap `Connect health data` and `Sync today` to import supported Health Connect records.
6. Use `AI Coach` or the `Run AI review` button to send the weekly training plan, day's log, set-level performance, photos, and your extra question to the model for adjustment guidance.

## Health data sync

The first health-data layer is Android Health Connect. The app requests read-only access to:

- Body weight
- Body fat
- Lean body mass
- Steps
- Sleep sessions
- Resting heart rate
- Total calories burned

This can support Xiaomi, Huawei, smart-scale, watch, and phone health data when those vendor apps sync or expose records through Health Connect and the user grants permission. The app does not bypass vendor privacy controls or read private manufacturer databases directly.

For deeper vendor-specific support, Huawei Health Kit can be added later as a dedicated provider module. Manual metrics remain available when Health Connect is unavailable, permissions are denied, or a vendor app does not export the needed records.

## Build

Use Android Studio with JDK 17 and a normal Android SDK installation.

1. Open `android-app/` in Android Studio.
2. Let Android Studio sync Gradle.
3. Build and run the `app` configuration on an emulator or phone.

This workspace currently does not include a local JDK/Android SDK, so APK compilation is expected to happen in Android Studio or another Android build machine.

## API setup

Open the app and fill in:

- `API key`: your provider key. It is stored locally in Android SharedPreferences and is not committed to source.
- `base URL`: default is `https://api.openai.com/v1`.
- `model`: default is `gpt-4.1-mini`; you can change this to any model your API provider supports.

The network client posts to:

```text
{base URL}/responses
```

It sends:

- `instructions`: the bundled skill prompt and selected references.
- `input_text`: your profile, log, or question.
- `input_image`: optional photos encoded as data URLs.

## Skill assets

The app reads the bundled skill assets from:

```text
app/src/main/assets/skill/
```

When you update the upstream skill, copy the updated files into that assets folder before rebuilding the app.

## Safety

This app is coaching support, not medical care. Photo/video form checks and food-photo nutrition estimates are approximate. The app should not be used for diagnosis, physical therapy, clinical dietetics, drug protocols, or official contest rules.
