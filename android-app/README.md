# I Want to be an IFBB PRO Android App

This is a native Android companion app for the `I Want to be an IFBB PRO` skill. It packages the skill assets inside the APK and lets you call an AI API for training, nutrition, visual form analysis, food-photo nutrition estimates, and linked check-ins.

## What is included

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose Android app.
- Bundled skill assets in `app/src/main/assets/skill/`.
- Apple-inspired light UI theme with a quiet neutral background, blue action color, rounded grouped surfaces, and bottom navigation for the main daily tabs.
- A `Today` Command Center with readiness, next action, training, nutrition, recovery, and body-composition cards so beginners know what to do first while advanced users can scan the key numbers.
- A `Daily Coach Checklist` on `Today` that tracks whether the plan is prepared, training is executed, food is logged, metrics are synced, and the AI review is locked for the day.
- Local daily log history with a 7-day trend summary for body weight, calories, protein, sleep, steps, hard sets, and training volume.
- Saved AI review history so the latest coaching guidance remains visible after the app closes.
- Athlete Profile setup for long-term goal, current phase, training experience, target weight/body fat, weekly training days, equipment, weak points, diet preference, and constraints. This profile is included in every daily AI review.
- Coach modes for new plans, check-ins, training visual analysis, food visual analysis, linked training + nutrition analysis, existing plan audit, and evidence explanations.
- Configurable API key, base URL, and model from the app UI.
- OpenAI Responses API request shape with text and photos.
- Photo picker support for exercise frames, equipment photos, food photos, labels, and menus.
- Plan Templates for `Beginner Full Body`, `4-Day Hypertrophy`, and `5-Day Physique Priority`, giving a ready-to-train weekly structure before manual editing.
- A weekly training plan workflow for phase goals, training days, planned exercises, sets, reps, RIR, rest time, and notes.
- An `Apply today` workflow that turns a planned training day into today's set-level executable workout log.
- A `Daily Execution Plan` on `Today` that turns training execution, nutrition gaps, recovery state, data completeness, and AI review timing into one priority focus, primary action, training decision, nutrition decision, recovery decision, data quality gate, AI review gate, and plan adjustment signal.
- A daily training workflow for planned focus, completed sessions, exercises, set-level load, reps, RIR, rest time, hard sets, target muscle, form/pain notes, and Exercise History comparison against previous logged sessions.
- A `Training Readiness Builder` on the training screen that turns Recovery Guidance into a warm-up strategy, ramp-up cue, first working set decision, volume adjustment, and stop rule before the user starts logging sets.
- A `Next Set Coach` on the training screen that finds the first unfinished working set and shows the current exercise, next set target, load cue, reps cue, RIR cue, rest cue, stop cue, after-set logging cue, and the same equipment/action instance diagram used by the Exercise Visual Library.
- A `Tomorrow Coach Brief` on Today that turns the saved plan, body-composition trend, nutrition status, session quality, and recovery signals into next-day training focus, calorie/protein targets, readiness gate, recovery action, tracking action, and the first action to take tomorrow.
- A `Session Quality Dashboard` on the training screen that summarizes completion rate, logged set rate, average RIR, completed volume, muscle-volume distribution, pain flags, technique flags, quality cue, capacity cue, and risk cue before the AI changes the plan.
- Exercise History on active exercise cards for previous date, previous/current volume, best load, best reps, completed sets, average RIR, and a short history-based guidance cue.
- Progression Cue on active exercise cards so the user can see whether to add reps, add load, hold, modify, or finish baseline work before waiting for the AI review.
- A unified exercise visual guide on planned and active workout cards, using stable visual guide IDs, simple equipment/action diagrams, Chinese equipment labels, unified instance diagram, action path cue, beginner recognition cue, equipment markers, instance diagram cues, example movements, common movement examples, and look-for cues for Smith machine, cable station, dumbbells, barbell, machine, adjustable bench, pull-up/dip station, resistance band, leg press or hack squat, and bodyweight/open-station movements so non-pro users can recognize what the exercise name refers to.
- `Selected Day Visual Map` in `Plan` and `Today's Exercise Visual Map` in `Training`, plus thumbnail headers on planned and active exercise cards, so the user can scan the day's equipment/action setup before searching the gym floor.
- A live equipment/action preview inside `Add Planned Exercise` and `Add Exercise`, so typing a movement name immediately maps it to the likely visual guide ID and visual category before the user saves it.
- An `Exercise Visual Library` on the plan screen that shows these visual categories together before the user adds a movement.
- A workout execution flow where tapping a set as complete starts a rest countdown for the next set.
- A daily nutrition workflow for calorie and macro targets, Nutrition Pacing, meal logging, meal photo support, and food-photo estimate follow-up.
- Meal Templates for quick-add nutrition logging: `Lean Protein Bowl`, `Pre-Workout Carbs`, `Low-Fat Protein Fix`, `Salmon Potato Plate`, and `Fiber + Micronutrient Add`.
- Nutrition Pacing shows calorie/protein/carb/fat/fiber remaining or over target, a macro adherence score, and a next-meal focus so the user knows what to eat next instead of only seeing a retrospective food log.
- Next Meal Builder turns remaining macros and training demand into the next practical meal target, including protein/carbs/fat/fiber grams, meal timing cue, portion uncertainty cue, and photo/label cue.
- Meal Assembly Guide turns the next-meal macro target into a practical plate structure, protein anchor, carb anchor, fat control, fiber/micros, shopping cue, prep cue, photo/logging cue, and avoid cue so a beginner knows what food to choose and what to photograph for AI estimation.
- Body Composition Guidance compares phase goal, body-weight trend, average calories, average protein, and training output before suggesting whether to hold targets or make a small calorie adjustment.
- Recovery Guidance compares sleep, fatigue, soreness, stress, resting heart rate, and planned/completed set pressure before suggesting whether to keep the plan, hold training stress, reduce volume, or run a deload check.
- A daily metrics workflow for body weight, waist, sleep, steps, hunger, fatigue, soreness, stress, and reflection.
- Health Connect sync for user-authorized body weight, body fat, lean body mass, steps, sleep, resting heart rate, and total calories burned. Xiaomi, Huawei, scale, watch, and phone data can be imported when the source app writes those records into Health Connect.
- An AI review workflow that summarizes the day and asks the model what to adjust tomorrow.
- AI review includes recent trend rows so recommendations can compare today's execution against recent training, nutrition, recovery, and body-composition direction.
- AI review output is saved locally and shown in `Today` as the latest guidance, with recent reviews available in `AI Coach`.
- An AI Data Map that makes the connected analysis surface explicit: exercise selection, set load, actual reps, RIR, rest time, hard sets, tonnage, Daily Execution Plan, priority focus, primary action, data quality gate, AI review gate, plan adjustment signal, Training Readiness Builder, Next Set Coach, current exercise, next set target, load cue, reps cue, RIR cue, rest cue, stop cue, after-set logging cue, Tomorrow Coach Brief, tomorrow training focus, tomorrow nutrition target, tomorrow recovery gate, tomorrow tracking action, readiness gate, Session Quality Dashboard, completion rate, logged set rate, average RIR, muscle-volume distribution, pain flags, technique flags, warm-up cue, ramp-up cue, first working set, volume adjustment, stop rule, Exercise History, Progression Cue, exercise visual guide, visual guide ID, equipment/action diagrams, selected-day visual map, today's exercise visual map, exercise thumbnail headers, live equipment/action preview, Chinese equipment labels, unified instance diagram, action path cue, beginner recognition cue, equipment markers, instance diagram cue, common movement examples, look-for cue, equipment photo recognition, technique notes, meal macros, Nutrition Pacing, Next Meal Builder, Meal Assembly Guide, plate structure, protein anchor, carb anchor, fat control, fiber/micros, shopping cue, prep cue, photo/logging cue, next meal macro targets, meal timing cue, portion uncertainty cue, Body Composition Guidance, Recovery Guidance, food photos, equipment/form photos, body weight, body fat, lean mass, waist, sleep, steps, resting heart rate, calorie burn, hunger, fatigue, soreness, and stress.

## Daily workflow

Use the app as a daily training and daily nutrition cockpit:

1. Set `Athlete Profile` in `Plan` so the app knows your phase, target, training schedule, equipment, weak points, and constraints.
2. Open `Today` to see the current training, nutrition, metrics, and readiness summary.
   The Command Center shows the next best action and a beginner-friendly daily loop: plan, train, log food, sync health data, then run AI review.
   The Daily Execution Plan turns the current log into the single highest-priority action and explains whether training, food, recovery, or data quality should be handled before trusting the AI review.
   The Daily Coach Checklist turns that loop into tappable steps: `Plan prepared`, `Training executed`, `Food logged`, `Metrics synced`, and `AI review locked`.
   The 7-day trend card shows whether body weight, food intake, hard sets, sleep, and activity are moving in the right direction.
3. Use `Plan` to pick a Plan Template or build the weekly training plan manually, select a day, add planned exercises, and tap `Apply today`.
4. Use `Training` to follow the Training Readiness Builder before the first set, then scan Today's Exercise Visual Map so each exercise name maps to a real machine, station, free weight, or bodyweight setup. Next Set Coach shows the current exercise, next set target, load/reps/RIR/rest cues, stop cue, after-set logging cue, and matching equipment/action instance diagram before tapping `Complete`. Session Quality Dashboard summarizes completion, logging quality, average RIR, muscle capacity, pain flags, and technique flags so the user knows whether the session is reliable enough for progression. Exercise History compares repeated movements against the previous logged session, while the exercise visual guide, visual map, thumbnail headers, live equipment/action preview, and Exercise Visual Library help identify the equipment/action through visual guide IDs, unified instance diagrams, Chinese labels, action path cues, beginner recognition cues, equipment markers, common movements, example movements, and look-for cues. Progression Cue tells whether to add reps, add load, hold, modify, or finish baseline work. Tap `Complete` after a set to start the rest timer.
5. Use `Nutrition` to set calorie/macronutrient targets, follow Nutrition Pacing for remaining calories/macros and next-meal focus, use Next Meal Builder for the next practical protein/carbs/fat/fiber target and timing cue, follow Meal Assembly Guide for the actual plate structure, protein anchor, carb anchor, fat control, shopping/prep cue, and food-photo logging cue, quick-add common meals from Meal Templates, check Body Composition Guidance before changing targets, log meals manually, and attach a meal photo when you want food-photo analysis.
6. Use `Metrics` for body weight, body fat, lean mass, waist, sleep, steps, resting heart rate, calorie burn, hunger, fatigue, soreness, stress, and daily reflection. Recovery Guidance turns those signals into conservative training-pressure guidance. Tap `Connect health data` and `Sync today` to import supported Health Connect records.
7. Use `AI Coach` or the `Run AI review` button to send the athlete profile, weekly training plan, day's log, set-level performance, photos, and your extra question to the model for adjustment guidance.

## Health data sync

The first health-data layer is Android Health Connect. The app requests read-only access to:

- Body weight
- Body fat
- Lean body mass
- Steps
- Sleep sessions
- Resting heart rate
- Total calories burned

This can support Xiaomi, Huawei, smart-scale, watch, and phone health data when those vendor apps sync or expose records through Health Connect and the user grants permission. The app does not bypass vendor privacy controls or read private manufacturer databases directly.

Current implementation status:

- Implemented now: Health Connect read-only sync for compatible records, including data that Xiaomi/Mi Fitness, Huawei, smart-scale, watch, or phone apps write into Health Connect.
- Not guaranteed by the app alone: a vendor app must actually export the metric to Health Connect, and the user must approve the permission.
- Future provider module: Huawei Health Kit can be added later for deeper Huawei ecosystem syncing when Health Connect does not expose enough data.
- Fallback: manual entry remains available when Health Connect is unavailable, permissions are denied, or a vendor app does not export the needed records.

## Build

Use JDK 17 with a normal Android SDK installation that includes Android API 36. The Gradle wrapper is included so the project builds with the tested Gradle version.

1. Open `android-app/` in Android Studio.
2. Let Android Studio sync Gradle.
3. Build and run the `app` configuration on an emulator or phone.

Command-line build:

```bash
cd android-app
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

## API setup

Open the app and fill in:

- `API key`: your provider key. It is stored locally in Android SharedPreferences and is not committed to source.
- `base URL`: default is `https://api.openai.com/v1`.
- `model`: default is `gpt-4.1-mini`; you can change this to any model your API provider supports.

The network client posts to:

```text
{base URL}/responses
```

It sends:

- `instructions`: the bundled skill prompt and selected references.
- `input_text`: your profile, log, or question.
- `input_image`: optional photos encoded as data URLs.

## Skill assets

The app reads the bundled skill assets from:

```text
app/src/main/assets/skill/
```

When you update the upstream skill, copy the updated files into that assets folder before rebuilding the app.

## Safety

This app is coaching support, not medical care. Photo/video form checks and food-photo nutrition estimates are approximate. The app should not be used for diagnosis, physical therapy, clinical dietetics, drug protocols, or official contest rules.
