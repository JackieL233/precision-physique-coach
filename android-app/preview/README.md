# Android App UI Preview

This folder contains a local, static preview of the `I Want to be an IFBB PRO` Android app UI.

Open `index.html` in a browser to review the Apple-inspired product feel without requiring Android Studio, an emulator, a JDK, or an APK build.

The preview mirrors the current Android app structure:

- Four primary zones in the bottom navigation: training / nutrition / metrics / ai, shown as 训练 / 饮食 / 身体数据 / AI in Chinese
- Semantic bottom-navigation icons for training, nutrition, body metrics, and AI instead of letter placeholders
- Today Flow Coach is folded into the AI daily overview/review layer with one next best action, daily loop progress, readiness, training sets, nutrition gap, AI gate, and a single primary button
- EN/中文 language switch preview for the app shell and core training flow, implemented with `data-en`, `data-zh`, and `setLanguage`
